* clojure/dev setup related
** TODO ability to use watch instead of release
** TODO determine how to package
- commit generated main.js every time
- put generated main.js in github releases
- main.js that loads clojurescript code?

** TODO clojurescript repl
currently cider opens clojure repl through shadow

* TODO command to download current image to current directory
* TODO test with preload
* TODO ignore old images
- store url for images viewed (or maybe image hash... though would still have to download if did that, so probably not)
- ignore those urls on subsequent viewings
- maybe later add hash checking additionally in case url changes

* TODO option to choose download command
e.g. aria2c instead of gallery-dl

* TODO choose download location
can just optionally download to current directory? maybe creating title

- key in tridactyl to open in wallpaper folder vs. database vs. completing-read
